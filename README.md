# Fashion MNIST Classification

This project implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, and the goal is to build a neural network that can classify these images into one of the categories.

The project explores various aspects of model design and training, including the use of convolutional layers, dropout for regularization, batch normalization, and optimization techniques.
