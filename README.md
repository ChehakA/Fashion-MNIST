# Fashion-MNIST
The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with regularization techniques to minimize overfitting. The project demonstrates key machine learning concepts such as model architecture, training, validation, and evaluation, with a focus on achieving high accuracy using dropout, batch normalization, and regularization
